# How to use 
Set up your venv, install one module from requirements.txt, run weibo.py and you are ready to go.


# Special Note 
This repo contains code excerpts from an ongoing group course project.  
These code excerpts are indeed written by me though.  

# About Cookies and the Logging Module
No need to fill in cookie in the json. This is only part of the original feature (of my course project).  
The logging module is also part of the original feature.
